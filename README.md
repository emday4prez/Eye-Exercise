# Eye-Exercise

This project was an exercise in CSS and JavaScript. The styling was accomplished using a combination of absolute and relative positioning. We also used the CSS transform property to translate the eyballs along the Y-axis. When combined with JavaScript onmousemove method, the eyeballs follow the mouse cursor. A good next step will be to make the eyes blink by clicking the mouse.
